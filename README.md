This is a repository for tracking changes to the program and implementing new features in a sensible way. Human readable (commented) code can be found in the "source-code" folder.

I'm one of several creators of this package. Since I've done most of the recent programming for this project, it's appropriate to make code change requests or bug reports here. This is not a place for questions about the social science behind the project, citation questions, etc. 

The official package correspondance email is csnp@cornell.edu, and this is the appropriate place for most questions about this package.

Other authors on the project are: Michael Genkin (mg324@cornell.edu), Liuyuan Chen, and Matthew Brashears (meb299@cornell.edu). My Cornell email is geb97@cornell.edu.
