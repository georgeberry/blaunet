}
\description{
Takes any output from dyadic blau functions (dyadic) and presents it in one matrix for further analysis outside of Blaunet or output to disk.
}
\usage{
export.dyadic(blauObj)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{blauObj}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{blauObj} here~~
